### Added - OpenSSF Scorecard Integration (Dec 19, 2024)

#### 🎯 Unified Security & Governance Scoring

Integrated OpenSSF Scorecard with custom properties compliance to produce a single unified score that includes both security best practices and governance compliance.

**Problem Solved:**

- Security posture (Scorecard) and governance compliance tracked separately
- No single metric to evaluate repository health holistically
- Custom properties compliance not weighted as part of overall security score
- Difficult to enforce minimum standards across both dimensions

**Solution:**

1. **Unified Compliance Workflow**

   - Runs custom properties compliance scan across all repos
   - Calculates compliance score (0-10) based on violations
   - Runs OpenSSF Scorecard for security checks
   - Merges compliance results into Scorecard as custom check
   - Recalculates aggregate score with compliance included

2. **Compliance Scoring Algorithm**

   ```
   Starting Score: 10.0

   For each violation:
     - Critical: -3.0 points
     - High:     -1.5 points
     - Medium:   -0.5 points
     - Low:      -0.2 points

   Minimum: 0.0
   Bonus: +0.5 for mature governance (3+ optional properties)
   ```

3. **Risk Weighting**

   - Custom Properties Compliance = **Critical** risk (10x weight)
   - Same weight as vulnerabilities, branch protection
   - Reflects importance of governance for automation

4. **SARIF Integration**
   - Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
   - Violations shown with severity levels
   - Linked to code scanning alerts
   - Full compliance history tracked

**Architecture:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Unified Compliance System              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. Properties Scanner → Score: 7.5/10  │
│  2. OpenSSF Scorecard  → Score: 8.2/10  │
│  3. Merge Results (SARIF)               │
│  4. Unified Score: 7.9/10               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Files Created:**

- `manager_repo/.github/workflows/unified-compliance.yml` - Main workflow (500+ lines)
- `docs/SCORECARD-INTEGRATION.md` - Complete integration guide
- `docs/examples/scorecard-badge-setup.md` - Badge configuration examples

**Features:**

✅ **Single Unified Score** - Security + Governance in one metric  
✅ **GitHub Security Tab** - Full SARIF integration  
✅ **Automated Issue Creation** - Weekly compliance reports  
✅ **Score Distribution Tracking** - Org-wide health metrics  
✅ **Tier-Based Requirements** - Different targets by customer tier  
✅ **Badge Support** - Display scores in README files  
✅ **Blocking Capability** - Can enforce minimum scores for deployments

**Usage:**

```bash
# Run unified compliance scan
gh workflow run unified-compliance.yml \
  --repo your-org/manager-repo

# With filters
gh workflow run unified-compliance.yml \
  -f repo_filter="customer-.*" \
  -f severity_filter=high \
  -f remediate=true
```

**Output Example:**

```
Unified Compliance Score: 8.2/10

Component Scores:
├─ OpenSSF Scorecard:      8.5/10  ✅
├─ Custom Properties:      7.9/10  ✅
├─ Total Repos:            142
└─ Compliant Repos:        128 (90%)

Distribution:
├─ Excellent (9-10):       68 repos
├─ Good (7-9):             42 repos
├─ Fair (5-7):             18 repos
└─ Poor (0-5):             14 repos
```

**Benefits:**

- 🎯 Holistic view of repository health
- 📊 Industry-standard security metrics + org-specific governance
- 🔍 Unified reporting and enforcement
- 📈 Track improvements over time across both dimensions
- 🚨 Block deployments on low scores (optional)
- 🏷️ Governance treated with same importance as security

**Integration Points:**

1. **Security Tab** - View all violations in one place
2. **Status Checks** - Can require minimum unified score
3. **Badges** - Display scores in README files
4. **Artifacts** - Download detailed JSON/SARIF reports
5. **Issues** - Automated compliance tracking

**Score Interpretation:**

| Score    | Grade | Meaning   | Action                   |
| -------- | ----- | --------- | ------------------------ |
| 9.0-10.0 | A+    | Excellent | Maintain                 |
| 7.0-8.9  | B     | Good      | Minor improvements       |
| 5.0-6.9  | C     | Fair      | Significant improvements |
| 3.0-4.9  | D     | Poor      | Urgent attention         |

### Added - Phase 3 Auto-Remediation (Dec 19, 2024)

#### 🤖 Automatic Content Type Drift Detection & Remediation

Implemented Phase 3 auto-remediation to handle repository restructuring scenarios (merges, splits, content changes).

**Problem Solved:**

- Repository merges (app + infra → monorepo) leave stale properties
- Repository splits leave incorrect content types
- Infrastructure addition/removal not reflected in properties
- Manual updates required, leading to drift

**Solution:**

1. **Structure Detection in Compliance Scanner**

   - Automatically detects actual repository content
   - Compares with declared `repo_content_type`
   - Identifies mismatches (missing or stale types)

2. **Safe Auto-Remediation**

   - ✅ Automatically **adds** missing content types when detected
   - ⚠️ **Suggests** (doesn't auto-remove) stale types for manual review
   - Full audit trail of all fixes

3. **Source Repo Validation Workflow**
   - Runs on every push to main/develop
   - Detects structure changes
   - Creates GitHub Issues with exact fix commands
   - Adds PR comments when structure changes

**Configuration:**

```json
{
  "auto_remediate": {
    "content_type_add_detected": true,      // Auto-add detected types
    "content_type_remove_missing": false    // Manual review for removal
  },
  "content_detection_rules": {
    "infra_indicators": ["infra", "terraform", "ansible", ...],
    "app_indicators": ["app", "src", "frontend", ...]
  }
}
```

**Files Created:**

- `source_monorepo/.github/workflows/validate-content-type.yml` - Source validation
- `docs/AUTO-REMEDIATION.md` - Complete remediation guide

**Files Updated:**

- `manager_repo/.github/compliance/config.json` - Added detection rules
- `manager_repo/.github/workflows/property-compliance.yml` - Added structure detection

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Automatic drift correction for safe cases
- ✅ Immediate detection of structure changes
- ✅ Clear guidance for manual review cases
- ✅ Prevents compliance violations from repo restructuring
- ✅ Full audit trail and reporting

**Example Auto-Fix:**

```
Repo: customer-monorepo
Before: repo_content_type: ["app"]
Detected: Has infra/ directory
After: repo_content_type: ["app", "infra"]  ← Auto-fixed!
```

---

### Added - Repository Content Type Classification (Dec 19, 2024)

#### 🏷️ New Property: `repo_content_type`

Added `repo_content_type` custom property to classify repositories by their content.

**Property Definition:**

- **Type**: Multi-select
- **Values**: `app`, `infra`
- **Purpose**: Identify what content the repository manages

**Use Cases:**

1. **Monorepo** (`["app", "infra"]`)

   - Contains both application and infrastructure code
   - Example: `source_monorepo/` with `app/` and `infra/` directories

2. **Infrastructure-Only** (`["infra"]`)

   - Contains only infrastructure code (Terraform, Ansible, K8s)
   - Example: `terraform-modules/`, `ansible-playbooks/`

3. **Application-Only** (`["app"]`)
   - Contains only application code, no infrastructure
   - Example: `frontend-webapp/`, `backend-api/`

**Benefits:**

✅ **Targeted Compliance**: Compliance scanner only requires `infrastructure_tools` and `customer_tier` for repos with `infra` content  
✅ **Skip Non-Infra Repos**: App-only repos don't need infrastructure properties  
✅ **Better Filtering**: Query repos by content type  
✅ **Accurate Reporting**: Know exactly which repos manage infrastructure  
✅ **Faster Scans**: Skip infrastructure checks for app-only repos

**Changes:**

- Updated `docs/CUSTOM-PROPERTIES.md` with `repo_content_type` definition
- Updated compliance config:
  - `repo_content_type` required for ALL repos
  - `infrastructure_tools` and `customer_tier` only required for repos with `infra` content
- Updated compliance scanner workflow to:
  - Check for `repo_content_type` property
  - Skip infrastructure checks for app-only repos
  - Log content types during scan
- Added examples:
  - `docs/examples/set-repo-content-types.sh` - Bulk setting script
  - `docs/examples/repo-content-type-examples.md` - Comprehensive guide with 5 repository patterns

**Migration:**

```bash
# Monorepo (both app and infra)
gh api repos/org/monorepo/properties/values -X PUT \
  -f properties[][property_name]='repo_content_type' \
  -f properties[][value][]='app' \
  -f properties[][value][]='infra'

# Infrastructure-only
gh api repos/org/terraform-modules/properties/values -X PUT \
  -f properties[][property_name]='repo_content_type' \
  -f properties[][value][]='infra'

# App-only (no infra properties needed!)
gh api repos/org/frontend-app/properties/values -X PUT \
  -f properties[][property_name]='repo_content_type' \
  -f properties[][value][]='app'
```

### Added - Compliance & Drift Detection System (Dec 19, 2024)

#### 🔍 Major Feature: Automated Property Compliance Scanning

Built a complete compliance scanning and drift detection system for GitHub Custom Properties with automated remediation and external synchronization.

**New Components:**

1. **Compliance Scanner Workflow** (`property-compliance.yml`)

   - 513 lines - Scans all org repositories every 6 hours
   - Validates properties against configurable rules
   - Detects 7 types of violations (missing, invalid, stale, team mismatches)
   - Auto-remediates low-risk issues (optional)
   - Creates/updates GitHub Issues with violation details
   - Generates detailed JSON reports as artifacts
   - Supports dry-run mode and severity filtering
   - Fails on critical violations to block deployments

2. **External Sync Tool** (`tools/sync-properties.js`)

   - 350 lines - Syncs GitHub properties with external sources of truth
   - Pluggable adapters: Billing System, LDAP/AD, CMDB, GitHub Teams
   - NPM scripts for common operations (`sync:all`, `sync:billing`, `sync:teams`)
   - Dry-run mode to preview changes
   - Detailed JSON result reports

3. **Compliance Configuration** (`.github/compliance/`)
   - `config.json` - Defines rules, valid values, severity levels
   - Configurable auto-remediation per violation type
   - Team rename mappings for smooth transitions
   - Repository exclusions for special cases

**Documentation:**

- `docs/COMPLIANCE.md` - 666 lines comprehensive guide with scenarios
- `manager_repo/.github/compliance/README.md` - Configuration reference
- `docs/examples/compliance-report-sample.md` - Example compliance report
- `docs/examples/compliance-webhook-integration.md` - Webhook integration patterns
- `COMPLIANCE-IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete implementation summary

**Violation Types Detected:**

| Type               | Description                     | Severity | Auto-Fix? |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| `missing_required` | Required property not set       | High     | No        |
| `invalid_value`    | Property has disallowed value   | High     | No        |
| `invalid_team`     | Team doesn't exist in org       | Critical | Yes\*     |
| `team_mismatch`    | Team doesn't have repo access   | Medium   | No        |
| `stale_property`   | Property unchanged for 90+ days | Low      | No        |

\*Auto-fix only when `remediate: true` flag set

**Common Scenarios Solved:**

✅ **Team Renames**: Add mapping to config, run with `remediate=true`, all repos auto-fixed  
✅ **Customer Tier Changes**: Billing webhook triggers sync, properties auto-updated  
✅ **Repository Transfers**: GitHub webhook detected, team ownership auto-synced  
✅ **New Compliance Requirements**: Add to config, scanner creates issue with all violations  
✅ **Drift Detection**: Automatic every 6 hours with GitHub Issue tracking

**Usage:**

```bash
# Run compliance scan
gh workflow run property-compliance.yml

# Auto-remediate low-risk issues
gh workflow run property-compliance.yml -f remediate=true

# External sync
cd manager_repo/tools && npm run sync:all
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Detect drift automatically every 6 hours
- ✅ Auto-fix team renames and safe violations
- ✅ Sync with external systems (billing, LDAP, CMDB)
- ✅ Real-time compliance status in GitHub Issues
- ✅ Webhook-ready for instant updates
- ✅ Comprehensive audit trail
- ✅ Production-ready with 2,300+ lines of code/docs

### Added - Custom Properties & Tool Orchestration (2024)

#### 🎯 Major Feature: GitHub Custom Properties Integration

Added support for GitHub Custom Properties to enable customer self-service infrastructure tool selection and configuration.

**What Changed:**

1. **Customer Repos (source_monorepo)**

   - Workflows now fetch repository custom properties
   - Properties passed as metadata to manager repo
   - Workflow blocks until infrastructure setup complete
   - Supports opt-in tool selection

2. **Manager Repo**

   - New `parse-capabilities` job to read customer properties
   - New `setup-spacelift-terraform` job for Terraform stack provisioning
   - New `setup-spacelift-ansible` job for Ansible stack provisioning
   - Infrastructure setup status posted back to customer repos
   - Conditional execution based on enabled tools

3. **Documentation**
   - New `CUSTOM-PROPERTIES.md` - Complete guide to custom properties
   - Example configurations for common patterns
   - Service provider onboarding script

**New Custom Properties:**

| Property                           | Type          | Purpose                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `infrastructure_tools`             | Multi-select  | Which tools to enable (terraform, ansible, etc.) |
| `terraform_version`                | Single-select | Terraform version for Spacelift                  |
| `spacelift_auto_deploy`            | Boolean       | Auto-deploy on main branch                       |
| `infrastructure_approval_required` | Boolean       | Require manual approval                          |
| `spacelift_stack_name`             | String        | Custom Spacelift stack name                      |
| `ansible_inventory_path`           | String        | Path to Ansible inventory                        |

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Customers control which tools are enabled via repository settings
- ✅ Service provider automatically provisions Spacelift stacks
- ✅ Customer workflows block until infrastructure is ready
- ✅ Transparent Spacelift setup - no manual configuration needed
- ✅ Easily add new tools (Pulumi, Crossplane) in the future

**Use Cases:**

```yaml
# Terraform only (most common)
infrastructure_tools: ["terraform"]
terraform_version: "1.6"

# Multi-tool advanced
infrastructure_tools: ["terraform", "ansible"]
terraform_version: "1.6"
ansible_inventory_path: "ansible/inventory/"

# Enterprise fast-track
infrastructure_tools: ["terraform"]
spacelift_auto_deploy: true
infrastructure_approval_required: false
customer_tier: "enterprise"
```

**Breaking Changes:** None - backward compatible

**Migration Guide:**

Existing customers:

1. No immediate action required
2. To opt-in: Set `infrastructure_tools` custom property
3. On next `infra/` change, Spacelift stack will be auto-created
